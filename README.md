# Speech-Assistant-App

A simple Python-based voice assistant application that can recognize and respond to user commands. This app allows you to interact with your system through voice, perform tasks like playing songs, fetching information, and interacting with web services like YouTube and Spotify.

## Features

- **Voice Command Recognition**: Recognize commands like "play song", "what is your name", and "what is the time".
- **Web Search Integration**: Search for songs on platforms like YouTube or Spotify directly using voice input.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: The assistant speaks back the results or responses to user queries.
- **Location Search**: Ask for locations and get Google Maps links.
- **Custom Commands**: Easily extendable to add more custom commands or features.

## Requirements

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `speech_recognition` for speech-to-text functionality
- `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech functionality
- `pyaudio` for microphone access
- `playsound` to play sounds or music files
- `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` for web scraping
- `webbrowser` for opening URLs
- `urllib.parse` for URL encoding

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Clone this repository to your local machine and set up a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Speech-Assistant-App.git
cd Speech-Assistant-App
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Record Audio & Respond

This application listens to your voice and recognizes commands using speech recognition. You can also customize it to handle additional commands based on your needs.

Run the application using:

```bash
python assistant.py
```

You can now interact with your assistant by saying commands like:
- "What is the time?"
- "Play song"
- "What is your name?"
- "Open YouTube"
- "Open Google Maps"

## Example Commands

Here are a few example commands you can use with the assistant:

1. **Play a song**:
   - Voice command: "Play song"
   - Response: "What song do you want to play?"
   - Opens a web browser with a YouTube or Spotify search for the song.

2. **Get the time**:
   - Voice command: "What time is it?"
   - Response: The assistant will speak the current time.

3. **Get location**:
   - Voice command: "Where is the nearest coffee shop?"
   - Response: The assistant will open Google Maps in your browser with the search for the location.

4. **Tell a joke or give a random response**:
   - Voice command: "Tell me a joke" or "What is your name?"
   - Response: A personalized or fun response from the assistant.

## Usage

Once you have set up everything and installed the dependencies, simply run the application:

```bash
python assistant.py
```

Your assistant will start listening for voice commands. Speak into the microphone, and it will respond accordingly.
